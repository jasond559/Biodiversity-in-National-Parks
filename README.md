# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks
Portfolio Project
IntroductionÂ¶
In this project we are analyzing data regarding species within several US National Parks. The data has been provided by Codecademy.com as part of the data science 2021 learning program.

Goals
The goal of this project is to use python and several libraries to explore, clean, and analyze data contained within two separate CSV files.

1. Explore -
We must first import the data to determine if any cleaning needs to occur prior to analysis.

2. Clean -
Any cleaning of the data must occur before we analyze for answers to our questions.

3. Analyze -
The questions we wish to answer about this data are as follows:

What is the distribution of species within the different protection statuses?
How likely are certain animal categories to be endangered in comparison with all species?
What are the most observed animal categories in each park?
